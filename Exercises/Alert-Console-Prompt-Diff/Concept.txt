In JavaScript, both console.log() and alert() are used for debugging purposes, but they serve different functions and are used in different contexts. 
 prompt() is used to display a dialog box that asks the user to input some data. It pauses the execution of the script until the user submits a response, similar to alert().

1. Non-Blocking Behavior
console.log(): Outputs messages to the browser’s developer console without interrupting the flow of the application. This allows you to log data in the background while the app continues to run smoothly.
alert(): Pauses the execution of the script and shows a modal dialog, forcing the user to interact (by clicking "OK") before the script can proceed. This interrupts the user experience and the application's flow.

In summary, console.log() is a better choice for debugging as it doesn't interfere with the application's flow, is easier to manage, and provides more robust capabilities for inspecting code behavior. alert() is typically only used in very specific cases where you want to notify or get confirmation from the user.

1. Use Case
prompt(): Its primary purpose is to collect user input. The dialog box contains a message and a text input field where the user can enter data.
console.log(): Used for logging information to the console for debugging purposes. It doesn't interact with the user and doesn't expect any input from them.
alert(): Just displays a message to the user, but doesn’t ask for input.

2. User Experience
prompt(): It interrupts the flow of the program by showing a modal dialog and waits for user input. Like alert(), it can be disruptive to the user experience.
console.log(): Does not interrupt the flow of the application and doesn’t require any user interaction, making it invisible to the user and ideal for debugging.
alert(): Also interrupts the flow by showing a pop-up message.

3. Purpose
prompt(): Used when the program needs input from the user, such as asking for their name, age, or other information. The user's input is returned as a string (or null if the user cancels).
console.log(): Primarily for debugging, to track variables, errors, or program flow. It’s not meant for user interaction.
alert(): Simply displays information to the user without expecting any input or feedback.

4. User Interaction
prompt(): Requires user interaction because the program won’t proceed until the user enters something and clicks "OK" or cancels the prompt.
console.log(): Does not require any interaction from the user.
alert(): Requires the user to click "OK" to dismiss the dialog box.

5. Performance and Practicality
prompt(): Not ideal for frequent or complex interactions. It’s considered outdated for modern web applications, which usually use form fields, modals, or custom UI for user input.
console.log(): Perfect for development and debugging, as it doesn’t disrupt the user’s experience and provides a more robust tool for developers.
alert(): Similar to prompt(), it's not suitable for frequent use in modern applications due to its disruptive nature.

Summary of Differences:
prompt() is used to gather input from the user but is disruptive and generally avoided in modern applications.
console.log() is used for debugging and does not interrupt the user experience.
alert() is used to display messages but also disrupts the user’s interaction with the page.

In modern development, developers tend to avoid prompt() and use HTML forms or custom UI elements for user input. They use console.log() for debugging to keep the application flow smooth and avoid disrupting the user experience.
